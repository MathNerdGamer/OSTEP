# Introduction to Operating Systems

* When a program runs, it does three things (ignoring a bunch of extra stuff done for performance):
    1. It *fetches* an instruction from memory.
    2. It *decodes* the instruction.
    3. It *executes* the instruction.
    4. Then, it starts from the beginning for the next instruction.
    * This is known as the *von Neumann* model of computing, named after John von Neumann.

* An *operating system* is essentially software that makes it easy to run programs.

* An operating system does this is by employing a technique known as *virtualization*.
    * Virtualization is taking a physical resource and abstracting away the implementation details to its most fundamental form.
    * As a result, operating systems are sometimes called *virtual machines* (as opposed to something like VirtualBox, which is technically a *virtual machine monitor*, or *hypervisor*).
    * Figuring out how an operating system might do this is one of the main goals of this course.

* In order for users to make use of the OS, *interfaces* (aka *APIs*) are provided in the form of a *system call* (*syscall*).
    * A few hundred syscalls may be provided by an OS.
    * These syscalls allow for practically all of the things an OS is made for, such as running programs, accessing memory or devices, or anything else that needs the OS to provide that layer of abstraction for access to physical hardware.
    * As a result, an operating system is said to provide a *standard library* for such actions.

* Since virtualization allows for shared use of system resources, an OS is sometimes referred to ask a *resource manager*.
    * Resources include, but are not limited to, CPU time for running a program (or, more commonly, **many** programs concurrently) and access to hardware attached to the system in the form of persistent storage, extra compute units (i.e., a GPU), or networking.
    * The operating system, in an attempt to keep some semblance of order in all of the chaos, has to manage these resources carefully and efficiently.
