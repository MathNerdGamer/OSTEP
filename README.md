# Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces Repository

Learning Operating Systems using the book ["Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) (OSTEP) by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau & Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau. This repository will hold my notes from my reading, as well as any source code I write independently to study the material.

Any homework or lab solutions from this course will be added as private submodules for my own use.
